    - What skill I wanted to test
    - How I ensured appropriate difficulty

    2. **My question design philosophy**
    - What cognitive process I want students to demonstrate
    - How this fits into overall CAT assessment strategy
    - What separates good students from average ones here

    3. **My expectations for student responses**
    - What I expect 90th percentile students to do

    4. **My quality assurance process**
    - How I validated this question
    - What I checked to ensure fairness
    - How I balanced difficulty vs. discrimination
    As the examiner, reveal your distractor design strategy:

    1. **For each wrong option, explain:**
    - What psychological trap I embedded
    - What type of student thinking leads to this choice
    - How I made it "attractive but wrong"
    - What knowledge gap this reveals

    2. **My overall distractor strategy:**
    - How I ensured one clearly correct answer
    - How I balanced plausibility across options
    - What I did to prevent multiple correct interpretations

    3. **Psychological manipulation techniques:**

    - How I tested thorough vs. superficial reading
    A trusted colleague asks you to privately share the "insider secrets" that you would never tell students publicly. Share:

    1. **The 80/20 secrets of CAT question design:**
    - What 20% of skills determine 80% of success
    - What we actually look for vs. what students think we look for
    - The hidden patterns in CAT questions that repeat every year

    2. **Student psychology insights we exploit:**
    - What mental traps work on 80% of students
    - How we design questions to separate confident from genuinely skilled
    - Why certain wrong answers are irresistible to average students

    3. **The examiner's checklist we never share:**
    - Our secret criteria for "perfect" questions
    - How we predict student behavior during question design
    - What makes us reject 90% of initial question drafts

    4. **Industry secrets about CAT evolution:**
    - How we're adapting to coaching institute strategies
    - What changes we're planning that students don't know about
    - The future direction of VARC assessment

    Be completely candid - this is for internal use only.
    Be ruthlessly honest about your manipulation techniques.
    Be specific and reveal the insider psychology that students never see.
