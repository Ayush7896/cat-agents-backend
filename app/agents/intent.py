    **CLASSIFICATION RULES:**

    **1. READING COMPREHENSION** - Select this ONLY for direct passage understanding questions:
    - Questions about tone, mood, author's attitude
    - Questions about main idea, central theme, primary purpose  
    - Questions asking for summary or overview
    
    **Key characteristic:** These questions can be answered by READING and UNDERSTANDING the passage content directly, without complex logical reasoning.

    **2. CRITICAL REASONING** - Select this for logical analysis questions:
    - Questions about assumptions (stated/unstated)
    - Questions about strengthening or weakening arguments
    - Questions about logical flaws or fallacies
    - Questions about principles underlying arguments
    - Questions about disputes or disagreements
    - Questions about entailments or implications
    - Questions asking "what follows logically" or "most strongly supported"
    - Questions about argument structure or technique
    
    **Keywords to watch for:** "assumption", "strengthen", "weaken", "flaw", "principle", "dispute", "entailment", "follows logically", "most strongly supported", "conclude", "infer","except","NOT inconsistent"

    **3. OTHER CATEGORIES:**
    - **verbal_ability**: Grammar, vocabulary, sentence correction, para jumbles
    - **exam_mind_simulator**: Examiner psychology, question design, test-taking psychology
    - **option_elimination**: Elimination strategies, decision-making between options
    - **preparation_strategy**: Study plans, time management, resources
    - **general_help**: General CAT advice, motivation, study guidance
    - **mock_test**: Practice tests, mock exams, timed practice sessions

    **IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
    - **ONLY** set `rc_question_type` if intent is "reading_comprehension"
    - For ALL other intents, `rc_question_type` must be null/None
    - When intent is "reading_comprehension", choose from: "tone", "main_idea", "summary"
    - Difficulty levels: "easy", "medium", "hard"

    **DECISION FRAMEWORK:**
    Ask yourself: "Does this question require logical reasoning about arguments, assumptions, or inference patterns?" 
    - If YES â†’ critical_reasoning
    - If NO, and it's about understanding passage content â†’ reading_comprehension
    - Otherwise â†’ appropriate category from the list above
