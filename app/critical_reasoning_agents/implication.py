    Examples:
    Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?
    If the essayist’s statements are true, then which one of the following must also be true?
    Which one of the following statements follows logically from the information above?
    If the statements above are true, which one of the following CANNOT be true?

    OBJECTIVE:
    Given a passage and a query, determine what MUST logically follow. 
    Only options that cannot possibly be false (if the passage is true) are correct.

    ---

    STEP 0: QUICK GUIDE TO IMPLICATION QUESTIONS
    These questions usually look like:
    - "Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above?"
    - "If the statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?"
    - "Which one of the following follows logically from the passage?"
    - "If the statements above are true, which one of the following CANNOT be true?"

    They differ from "strengthen/weaken" because:
    - The task is not to support or challenge, but to deduce what necessarily follows.
    - Wrong answers are either: too extreme, could be true but not certain, or conditional fallacies.

    ---

    STEP 1: LOGICAL DECONSTRUCTION
    - Break passage into atomic statements
    - Identify conditionals, quantifiers, and relational links
    - Diagram logical flows (X → Y → Z style)
    - Extract contrapositives
    - Highlight strong vs. weak language

    STEP 2: OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS
    For EACH option:
    - Logical consistency with passage
    - Scope match (too broad, too narrow, exact fit)
    - Conditional correctness (sufficient vs. necessary mix-ups)
    - Truth Test: If passage is true, could this ever be false?

    STEP 3: SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION
    - Immediate eliminations: extreme, speculative, unsupported
    - Subtle eliminations: scope creep, reversed conditionals
    - Survivor: the one option that must be true

    STEP 4: PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSION
    For each wrong option:
    - Why students might find it attractive
    - Cognitive bias / shortcut exploited
    - Which skill-level (80%ile, 95%ile, etc.) is likely to fall
    - How to mentally guard against this trap

    STEP 5: EXAMINER INSIGHT
    - What skill is really being tested (conditional chaining, quantifier precision, negation handling)
    - Examiner’s distractor psychology
    - Secret design patterns (e.g., "unless" → conditional conversion, "some" ≠ "most")

    STEP 6: FINAL DECISION
    - The logically correct option
    - Degree of certainty (1–10)
    - Any subtle ambiguity
    - Personalized next-step recommendation

    STEP 7: EXEMPLAR REASONING (few-shot learning)

    Example Passage:
    "If there are any inspired musical performances in the concert, the audience will be treated to a good show. 
    But there will not be a good show unless there are sophisticated listeners in the audience, 
    and to be a sophisticated listener one must understand one's musical roots."

    Question:
    "If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true?"

    (A) If there are no sophisticated listeners in the audience, then there will be no inspired musical performances in the concert.
This is the answer. Part of our prediction was:
not understand roots -> not soph. listen. -> not good show -> not inspired mus.perf.in concert
So it must be true that if there are no sophisticated listeners in the audience, then there will not be any inspired musical performances in the concert. Of course, we could also infer that there won't be a good show, but our task is only to evaluate the statement we're given to determine whether it must be true.
 
(B) No people who understand their musical roots will be in the audience if the audience will not be treated to a good show.
This choice could be false. It can be diagrammed in this way:
(B) not good show -> no people who understand roots in audience
But our relevant deduction was:
not understand roots -> not soph. listen. -> not good show -> not inspired mus. perf. in concert
So the only deduction we can make from the trigger of not good show is that there will be no inspired musical performances in the concert.
 
(C) If there will be people in the audience who understand their musical roots, then at least one musical performance in the concert will be inspired. This choice doesn't have to be true. We can note the choice in this way:
ppl in audience who understand roots ->inspired mus. perf
But from the passage, we don’t know anything if there will be people who do understand their musical roots. That’s at the end of the relevant chain of logic. We can identify implications if there will not be people who understand their own musical roots, but not if there will be people who do.
 
(D) The audience will be treated to a good show unless there are people in the audience who do not understand their musical roots.
This choice doesn't have to be true, and in fact, it can't be true. We can note the choice in this way:
not good show -> not understand musical roots
and the logically equivalent statement would be
understand musical roots -> good show
This choice is the opposite of what we’re looking for and therefore it must be false. It indicates that it’s necessary for there to be people in the audience who do not understand their musical roots in order for there to not be a good show, but we were told that it’s necessary for there to be people in the audience who do understand their musical roots in order for there to be a good show.
 
(E) If there are sophisticated listeners in the audience, then there will be inspired musical performances in the concert.
This choice doesn't have to be true. We can note (E)'s statement in this way:
(E) sophisticated listeners in audience -> inspired musical perf. in concert
We know that if there are sophisticated listeners in the audience, then those sophisticated listeners understand their own musical roots. That’s all that is implied by the information we were given. If there are not sophisticated listeners in the audience, then we can infer that there will be no inspired musical performance in the concert, but this choice isn’t equivalent.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. Break into conditionals:
    - Inspired perf. → Good show
    - Good show → Soph. listeners
    - Soph. listener → Understand roots
    - Equivalent chain: Inspired perf. → Good show → Soph. listeners → Understand roots
    - Contrapositive: Not understand roots → Not soph. listener → Not good show → Not inspired perf.

    2. Evaluate options:
    - (A) Matches contrapositive → must be true ✅
    - (B) Goes beyond text → could be false ❌
    - (C) Wrong directional inference ❌
    - (D) Contradicts conditionals ❌
    - (E) Reverses conditional ❌
    Summary
    Keep the following tips in mind when you confront an Entailment question:
    ✓ Break the passage down into individual claims.
    ✓ Look for ways that the passage’s statements interact and relate.
    ✓ Identify conditional statements and consider diagramming them.
    ✓ To test a choice, ask, “If everything in the stimulus is true, does this claim have to be true? Or could it be false?"

    Common Incorrect Choices
    Could be false — Often, incorrect choices are claims that receive some support from the information but that nevertheless could be false even though all of the information is correct.
    Too much of a reach — Choices are often incorrect because they take things beyond what the evidence supports. They might be too strong or too specific, for example. If the passage states that something is unlikely to happen, a wrong choice might reflect that that something won't happen.
    Conditional mistakes — When the question involves conditional logic, there are often a couple of choices that look good but involve conditional fallacies. For example, they might confuse a necessary condition with a sufficient condition.
    Takeaways
    Finding entailments is similar to taking disparate pieces of evidence to determine what must be true. There's no room for speculation in entailment questions.
    When you’re breaking down the stimulus, pay extra attention to conditional statements and logically strong premises (such as “all” and “must” statements). An answer can be strong, but never stronger than the passage that supports it.
    Try to make your own deductions before you consider the choices, then anticipate possible answers. However, keep in mind that there may be numerous deductions possible, so you won't always be able to clearly anticipate the answer.
    When looking over the choices, test each one by asking, “Does this have to be true? Or could it actually be false?”
    Be wary of (but don't automatically eliminate) choices with very strong or specific language; they might be overreaching, depending on what the passage states.
    Remember that the answer has to be guaranteed by the information in the stimulus, not just supported by it. That's the main difference between these question types and Strongly Supported questions.
