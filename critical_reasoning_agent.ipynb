    "    Passage: \"Some paleontologists have suggested that Apatosaurus, a huge dinosaur, was able to gallop. This, however, is unlikely, because galloping would probably have broken Apatosaurus's legs. Experiments with modern bones show how much strain they can withstand before breaking.

    "    - SUPPORT 2: \"Experiments with modern bones show how much strain they can withstand\"\n",
    "    - SUPPORT 3: \"it is possible to calculate that those bones could not have withstood the strains\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Reasoning: The word \"however\" signals opposition to the paleontologists' claim, making \"this is unlikely\" the main conclusion.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    **STEP 2: MAIN CONCLUSION IDENTIFICATION**\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Question: What is the arguer trying to convince us of?\n",
    "    Answer: \"The paleontologists are wrong - Apatosaurus couldn't gallop\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Paraphrase Test: \"Some paleontologists think Apatosaurus could gallop, but they're wrong.\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Support Test: Everything else (bone experiments, calculations, breakage risk) supports this central claim.\n",

    "    Support Indicators Found: \"because\" (introduces supporting evidence)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Rule: Statements with support indicators (because, since, for) cannot be main conclusions.\n",

    "    **SYSTEMATIC COT PROCESS FOR ANY ARGUMENT:**\n",
    "\n",

    "    - Map each sentence: Background/Support/Sub-conclusion/Main conclusion?\n",
    "    - Identify indicator words (however, but, therefore, because, since)\n",
    "    - Note argument flow and logical relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "    **STEP 2: \"POINT\" IDENTIFICATION**\n",
    "    - Ask: \"What is the ONE thing this argument wants me to believe?\"\n",
    "    - Look for predictions, value judgments, interpretations, recommendations\n",
    "    - Paraphrase the main message in simple terms\n",
    "\n",
    "    **STEP 3: VALIDATION TESTS**\n",
    "    - Does everything else support this claim?\n",
    "    - Does this claim support any other claim? (If yes, it's sub-conclusion)\n",
    "    - Remove this claim - does the argument lose its purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "    **STEP 4: OPTION ANALYSIS**\n",
    "    - Eliminate options with support indicators (because, since, for)\n",
    "    - Eliminate sub-conclusions (supported but also support others)\n",
    "    - Eliminate background/context information\n",
    "    - Match remaining options to your paraphrase\n",
    "\n",

    "    - **Sub-Conclusion Trap**: \"Therefore X, which means Y\" - X is sub-conclusion, Y is main\n",
    "    - **Support Trap**: Strong evidence that feels important but only supports the real conclusion\n",
    "    - **Scope Trap**: Too broad (\"All dinosaurs\") or too narrow when argument is moderate\n",
    "    - **Inference Trap**: Something you can deduce but isn't the argument's goal\n",
    "\n",
    "    **PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    **STUDENT VULNERABILITIES:**\n",
    "    - Confusing strong supporting evidence with the conclusion\n",
    "    - Falling for sub-conclusions that \"sound conclusive\"\n",
    "    - Choosing detailed specific claims over broader main points\n",
    "    - Missing argument structure due to complex language\n",
    "\n",
    "    **EXAMINER DESIGN PSYCHOLOGY:**\n",
    "    - Main conclusion often has moderate, measured language\n",
    "    - Wrong options test different reasoning skills (structure recognition, inference, scope)\n",
    "    - Correct answer always passes the \"everything supports this\" test\n",
    "    - Distractors exploit common student reasoning errors\n",
    "\n",
    "    **CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION:**\n",
    "    - High confidence (9-10): Clear indicators, obvious structure, perfect match\n",
    "    - Medium confidence (6-8): Some ambiguity but logical tests strongly support one answer\n",
    "    - Low confidence (3-5): Complex structure, need to re-analyze relationships\n",

    "    (A) If there are no sophisticated listeners in the audience, then there will be no inspired musical performances in the concert.\n",
    "This is the answer. Part of our prediction was:\n",
    "not understand roots -> not soph. listen. -> not good show -> not inspired mus.perf.in concert\n",
    "So it must be true that if there are no sophisticated listeners in the audience, then there will not be any inspired musical performances in the concert. Of course, we could also infer that there won't be a good show, but our task is only to evaluate the statement we're given to determine whether it must be true.\n",

    "(B) No people who understand their musical roots will be in the audience if the audience will not be treated to a good show.\n",

    "(B) not good show -> no people who understand roots in audience\n",
    "But our relevant deduction was:\n",

    "    Summary\n",
    "    Keep the following tips in mind when you confront an Entailment question:\n",
    "    ✓ Break the passage down into individual claims.\n",
    "    ✓ Look for ways that the passage’s statements interact and relate.\n",
    "    ✓ Identify conditional statements and consider diagramming them.\n",
    "    ✓ To test a choice, ask, “If everything in the stimulus is true, does this claim have to be true? Or could it be false?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Common Incorrect Choices\n",
    "    Could be false — Often, incorrect choices are claims that receive some support from the information but that nevertheless could be false even though all of the information is correct.\n",
    "    Too much of a reach — Choices are often incorrect because they take things beyond what the evidence supports. They might be too strong or too specific, for example. If the passage states that something is unlikely to happen, a wrong choice might reflect that that something won't happen.\n",
    "    Conditional mistakes — When the question involves conditional logic, there are often a couple of choices that look good but involve conditional fallacies. For example, they might confuse a necessary condition with a sufficient condition.\n",
    "    Takeaways\n",
    "    Finding entailments is similar to taking disparate pieces of evidence to determine what must be true. There's no room for speculation in entailment questions.\n",
    "    When you’re breaking down the stimulus, pay extra attention to conditional statements and logically strong premises (such as “all” and “must” statements). An answer can be strong, but never stronger than the passage that supports it.\n",
    "    Try to make your own deductions before you consider the choices, then anticipate possible answers. However, keep in mind that there may be numerous deductions possible, so you won't always be able to clearly anticipate the answer.\n",
    "    When looking over the choices, test each one by asking, “Does this have to be true? Or could it actually be false?”\n",
    "    Be wary of (but don't automatically eliminate) choices with very strong or specific language; they might be overreaching, depending on what the passage states.\n",
    "    Remember that the answer has to be guaranteed by the information in the stimulus, not just supported by it. That's the main difference between these question types and Strongly Supported questions.\n",

    "    OBJECTIVE:\n",

    "\n",
    "    STEP 0: QUICK GUIDE TO STRONGLY SUPPORTED QUESTIONS\n",
    "    These questions usually look like:\n",
    "    - \"Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above?\"\n",
    "    - \"Which one of the following can most reasonably be concluded on the basis of the information above?\"\n",

    "    - \"Which of the following most logically completes the argument?\"\n",
    "    - \"Of the following claims, which one can most justifiably be rejected?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Key difference from Implication:\n",
    "    - Implication = what MUST be true (cannot be false).\n",
    "    - Strongly Supported = what is BEST supported (even if not guaranteed).\n",
    "    - Wrong answers are: too extreme, speculative, unsupported, or merely “possible but not backed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 1: PASSAGE UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "    - Break the passage into atomic claims\n",
    "    - Note overlaps: which ideas link X → Y → Z\n",
    "    - Diagram conditionals if needed\n",
    "    - Mark strong vs. weak language (all/never vs. some/may)\n",
    "    - Ask: What “picture of reality” is the passage painting?\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 2: OPTION-BY-OPTION TEST\n",
    "    For EACH option:\n",
    "    - Does the passage actively support this claim?\n",
    "    - Can I point to 1–2 places in the passage that back it up?\n",
    "    - Is the wording too strong compared to the stimulus?\n",
    "    - Is it outside scope (new idea not present)?\n",
    "    - Test with the “Reasonable Reader Rule”: If someone only had the passage, would they naturally believe this?\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 3: ELIMINATION\n",
    "    - Eliminate options with:\n",
    "    - Extreme language not in passage\n",

    "    - Plausible-sounding but unsupported claims\n",
    "    - Keep the option with clearest textual backing, even if not airtight\n",

    "    Example Passage:\n",
    "    \"Birds and mammals can be infected with West Nile virus only through mosquito bites. \n",
    "    Mosquitoes, in turn, become infected with the virus when they bite certain infected birds or mammals. \n",
    "    The virus was originally detected in northern Africa and spread to North America in the 1990s. \n",
    "    Humans sometimes catch West Nile virus, but the virus never becomes abundant enough in human blood to infect a mosquito.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question:\n",
    "    \"The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    (A) West Nile virus will never be a common disease among humans.  \n",
    "    (B) West Nile virus is most common in those parts of North America with the highest density of mosquitoes.  \n",
    "    (C) Some people who become infected with West Nile virus never show symptoms of illness.  \n",
    "    (D) West Nile virus infects more people in northern Africa than it does in North America.  \n",
    "    (E) West Nile virus was not carried to North America via an infected person.  \n",

    "    - Infection chain: Mosquito ↔ Birds/mammals (but not humans).\n",
    "    - Virus origin: Africa → North America.\n",
    "    - Humans infected by mosquitoes, but cannot infect back.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Evaluate options:\n",
    "    - (A) Too extreme: “never” is unjustified. ❌\n",
    "    - (B) Possible but unsupported: no data on mosquito density vs. prevalence. ❌\n",
    "    - (C) Plausible but unstated: nothing about symptoms. ❌\n",
    "    - (D) Unsupported comparison: no data on infection rates Africa vs. North America. ❌\n",
    "    - (E) Supported: If humans can’t infect mosquitoes, humans could not carry it. ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correct Answer: (E), certainty 9/10.\n",
    "    Why not 10/10? Because while not airtight, it’s clearly best-supported.\n",

    "\n",
    "    STEP 4: CATEGORIZE THE STATEMENT\n",
    "    Ask: What is this claim *doing*? Possible categories:  \n",
    "    - **Main conclusion** (the author’s central opinion).  \n",

    "\n",
    "    STEP 1: SPOT THE QUESTION\n",
    "    - Common stems:  \n",
    "    • “Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?”  \n",
    "    • “The journalist’s reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles?”  \n",
    "    • “The situation described above conforms most closely to which one of the following generalizations?”  \n",
    "    • “The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?”\n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 2: RESTATE ARGUMENT OR SITUATION\n",
    "    - If passage = argument → Identify **conclusion + support**.  \n",
    "    - If passage = situation → Summarize events and relationships in your own words.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 3: ABSTRACT TO PRINCIPLE\n",
    "    - Ask: “What general rule is this specific case showing or relying on?”  \n",
    "    - Convert specifics into broad, universal terms.  \n",
    "    Example: “George must wear a seat belt while driving his truck” → General principle = “One must wear a seat belt while driving any vehicle.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 4: PREDICT\n",
    "    - If possible, form a rough principle:  \n",
    "    • *Situation-based* → A broad life lesson or generalization (“An organization can succeed even if members act selfishly”).  \n",
    "    • *Argument-based* → A principle that connects evidence to conclusion (“If a factor reduces fatigue and increases awareness, it contributes to safety”).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    STEP 5: MATCH TO CHOICES\n",
    "    - Check each choice:  \n",
    "    • Does every part of the choice map to the stimulus?  \n",
    "    • Avoid choices that go beyond the scope or introduce irrelevant elements.  \n",
    "    • Eliminate weakeners or neutral statements.  \n",
    "\n",

    "    ### STEP 1: Identify the Question Type\n",
    "    Typical weaken stems include:\n",
    "    - \"Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\"\n",
    "    - \"Which one of the following, if true, most calls into question the efficacy of the traditional treatment described above?\"\n",

    "    - \"Which one of the following, if true, most undermines the claim made above?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### STEP 2: Core Reasoning Process\n",
    "    1. **Break down the argument**\n",
    "    - Identify the conclusion\n",
    "    - Identify the support\n",
    "    - Frame it as: \"The author believes [conclusion], because [support]\"\n",
    "    - Spot the logical **gap** between support and conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Evaluate logical gaps**\n",
    "    - Scope shift? (support about X but conclusion about Y)\n",
    "    - Causation leap? (confusing correlation with causation)\n",
    "    - Representativeness issue? (small/biased sample → broad conclusion)\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Apply the weaken test**\n",
    "    - If added, does the option make the conclusion **less likely**?\n",
    "    - Rule out “no effect” answers\n",
    "    - Remember: weaken ≠ disprove, it just reduces the strength\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### STEP 3: Common Incorrect Choices\n",
    "    - **Out of scope**: introduces irrelevant details  \n",
    "    - **Strengtheners**: accidentally support the conclusion instead  \n",
    "    - **No impact**: information unrelated to argument’s link  \n",
    "    - **Restating support**: repeats existing premise without addressing gap  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ### STEP 4: Work Through Example\n",
    "    Argument:  \n",
    "    \"In its coverage of a controversy regarding a proposal to build a new freeway, a television news program showed twice as many interviews with opponents as with supporters. Therefore, the program is biased against the freeway.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question: Which one most seriously weakens?  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Options:  \n",
    "    (A) Viewers were already aware of the controversy → irrelevant (no effect)  \n",
    "    (B) Viewers don’t expect bias-free news → irrelevant (no effect)  \n",
    "    (C) Opponents spoke with more emotion → irrelevant (or slight strengthen)  \n",
    "    (D) Twice as many people in the population opposed freeway before airing → **WEAKENS** (interview ratio reflects reality, not bias)  \n",
    "    (E) Station’s business interests are harmed by freeway → **STRENGTHENS** (provides motive for bias)  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Correct Answer: (D).  \n",
    "\n",
    "    ### STEP 5: Strategies for Weaken Questions\n",
    "    ✓ Always check causal claims → alternate causes often weaken  \n",
    "    ✓ For survey/study arguments → show sample bias or irrelevance  \n",
    "    ✓ For generalizations → show counterexamples  \n",
    "    ✓ Test each option: add it mentally and ask: “Does this make conclusion less likely?”  \n",

    "        \"passage\": \"\"\"(. . .) There are three other common drivers for carnivore-human attacks, some of which are more preventable than others. Natural aggression-based conflicts – such as those involving females protecting their young or animals protecting a food source – can often be avoided as long as people stay away from those animals and their food.\n",
    "        Carnivores that recognise humans as a means to get food, are a different story. As they become more reliant on human food they might find at campsites or in rubbish bins, they become less avoidant of humans. Losing that instinctive fear response puts them into more situations where they could get into an altercation with a human, which often results in that bear being put down by humans. \"A fed bear is a dead bear,\" says Servheen, referring to a common saying among biologists and conservationists.\n",
    "        Predatory or predation-related attacks are quite rare, only accounting for 17% of attacks in North America since 1955. They occur when a carnivore views a human as prey and hunts it like it would any other animal it uses for food. (. . .)\n",
    "\n",
    "        Then there are animal attacks provoked by people taking pictures with them or feeding them in natural settings such as national parks which often end with animals being euthanised out of precaution. \"Eventually, that animal becomes habituated to people, and [then] bad things happen to the animal. And the folks who initially wanted to make that connection don't necessarily realise that,\" says Christine Wilkinson, a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, California, who's been studying coyote-human conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "        After conducting countless postmortems on all types of carnivore-human attacks spanning 75 years, Penteriani's team believes 50% could have been avoided if humans reacted differently. A 2017 study co-authored by Penteriani found that engaging in risky behaviour around large carnivores increases the likelihood of an attack.\n",
    "        Two of the most common risky behaviours are parents leaving their children to play outside unattended and walking an unleashed dog, according to the study. Wilkinson says 66% of coyote attacks involve a dog. \"[People] end up in a situation where their dog is being chased, or their dog chases a coyote, or maybe they're walking their dog near a den that's marked, and the coyote wants to escort them away,\" says Wilkinson.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Experts believe climate change also plays a part in the escalation of human-carnivore conflicts, but the correlation still needs to be ironed out. \"As finite resources become scarcer, carnivores and people are coming into more frequent contact, which means that more conflict could occur,\" says Jen Miller, international programme specialist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service. For example, she says, there was an uptick in lion attacks in western India during a drought when lions and people were relying on the same water sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "        (. . .) The likelihood of human-carnivore conflicts appears to be higher in areas of low-income countries dominated by vast rural landscapes and farmland, according to Penteriani's research. \"There are a lot of working landscapes in the Global South that are really heterogeneous, that are interspersed with carnivore habitats, forests and savannahs, which creates a lot more opportunity for these encounters, just statistically,\" says Wilkinson.\n",

    "        options:\n",
    "        A) Climate change has had negligible effects on the frequency of carnivore-human interactions in affected regions.\n",
    "        B) Carnivores lose their instinctive fear of humans when consistently exposed to human food sources.\n",
    "        C) Predatory attacks by carnivores are a common occurrence and have steadily increased over the past few decades.\n",
    "        D) Human efforts to avoid risky behaviors around large carnivores have proven effective in reducing conflict incidents.\n",

      "2. **Support**: The passage provides evidence of different types of conflicts, such as those caused by carnivores losing fear of humans due to food exposure, predatory attacks, and risky human behaviors.\n",

      "- **(B) Carnivores lose their instinctive fear of humans when consistently exposed to human food sources.**\n",
      "  - If false, it would contradict the passage's concern that exposure to human food makes carnivores less avoidant of humans, leading to more conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **(C) Predatory attacks by carnivores are a common occurrence and have steadily increased over the past few decades.**\n",
      "  - If false, it would align with the passage's statement that predatory attacks are rare, thus consistent with the passage.\n",

      "- **(D) Human efforts to avoid risky behaviors around large carnivores have proven effective in reducing conflict incidents.**\n",
